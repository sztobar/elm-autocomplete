Elm autocomplete example

Inspired by [David Nolen](https://github.com/swannodette/) blog post on writing similar ui widget in [clojurescript](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/17/comparative). Elm doesn't have any csp library and dropped usage of FRP with 0.17 update. With [Elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) the same functionality could be accomplished with readable and reasonable codebase.

Use `init.sh` to launch this example. Requires [Elm live](https://github.com/tomekwi/elm-live)
